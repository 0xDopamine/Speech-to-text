# Speech-to-text

An app that takes a path to an audio file, and returns the transcript of what's been said.
Using AssemblyAI API.


To test it:
-Run script.sh and pass the path to the audio file as an argument
(it could take a while to process the audio but be patient)
-The transcript is outputted to a file called "output".
